![Poster of the talks](/img/blog/common/2019-04-06emergenciaclimatica.jpg)

This Saturday, April 6, our rebel Claudia Bosch has been in our representation at a round table What does the young people think about the climate emergency? This round table was scheduled within a 12h day of talks on the climatic emergency topic entitled Climate reality = Social emergency where 50 scientists have participated, contributing from different fields how they see the future that awaits us.

This intense and reflective day have been recorded so that anyone can see it and learn from it. Most of the talks are in spanish but there is some in catalan too. 

The round table where we participate lasts about 45 minutes and you can see them at 07:14:10 and the participants talk in Spanish.
