![Newsletter](/img/blog/common/butlleti.jpg)

Dear rebels, 

Welcome to the first newsletter from XR Barcelona! 

We’re starting this newsletter at a critical time. On July 6th, we took to the streets in our first large-scale act of non-violent civil disobedience, and soon we’ll be taking to the streets again, this time united with thousands of other rebels around the world in two acts of global rebellion. Now more than ever, it’s time to spread the word and welcome as many new rebels as possible to XR Barcelona! 

## We need you: 
**27/09 Barcelona.** Global Climate Strike. More info in early September. 

**07/10 Madrid.** International Climate Rebellion. XR Barcelona joins other XR groups in Madrid as XR rebels unite in major cities around the world. Transport organised from Barcelona. 

And now, the news… 


###  500,000 OF FUNDING FOR EXTINCTION REBELLION AND OTHER GRASSROOTS GROUPS 

A group of wealthy, US-based philanthropists spearheaded by Trevor Nielson, Rory Kennedy and Aileen Getty have set up a $500,000 Climate Emergency Fund to support Extinction Rebellion and other grassroots groups in the fight to save the planet – and they vow to raise millions more. 

In the last XR Barcelona assembly, we voted to accept an initial sum of $5,000, with a further sum of $50,000 to come should we again vote to accept it. Of the initial $5,000, 80% will be used to liberate 4 rebels to work full-time in preparation for the International Climate Rebellion on October 7th.

### XR Barcelona BLOCKS GRAN VÍA DE LES CORTS CATALANES 

On July 6th, XR Barcelona blocked Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes at Gloriès for 12 minutes, at the point where thousands of cars enter the city every hour from the C-32/C-31 motorway. 

This symbolic act of civil disobedience was done in solidarity with the groups Aturem C-32 and SOS Costa Brava, who for more than 30 days had been attempting to stop trees being felled for the expansion of the C-32 motorway. With it, we sent a clear message to the Catalan Government: Declaring a climate emergency is not enough. Act on your words, or your words mean nothing. 

###7 DEMANDS FOR ADA COLAU 

On July 10th, XR Barcelona, Fridays For Future Barcelona, Families For Future Barcelona, Moviment per la Justícia Climàtica and Climacció delivered a letter to Ada Colau outlining seven urgent measures to help Barcelona confront the climate crisis, including stopping the expansion of the city's port and airport. The letter requested a meeting with the mayor on September 27th to discuss her position on the seven measures.

### STAY GROUNDED
On July 14th, rebels from XR Barcelona joined rebels from Climacció in a performative act of protest at El Prat airport against the planned construction of a third runway, a project that would lead to 20 million more passengers flying in and out of Barcelona every year. The action was a huge success, and was covered by several major news outlets.

### SPEAKERS NEEDED (no experience required)

In the run up to October 7th, XR Barcelona’s Speaking Committee is working harder than ever to spread the word about Extinction Rebellion, and new volunteer speakers are desperately needed. 

19 rebels attended the first informal training session on how to give effective talks about the movement, and another training session is planned for September (info coming soon). If you want to be a voice for XR Barcelona, we want you!

###XR ARTISTS MAKE AN IMPACT 

XR Barcelona’s artists have been very busy this month. Groups of rebels have been stencilling in Poble Sec, with more graffiti planned in Gràcia and Sants. The Art Committee created a striking Goddess of the Sea costume for the action on July 6th. Meanwhile, the Visual Impacts Committee has printed over 60 second-hand t-shirts, along with countless flags, banners and placards. 

Want your t-shirt stamped with the XR logo? Bring it to the next assembly and Visual Impacts will stamp it and return it to you.

### REBELS TEACH THE NEXT GENERATION

XR Barcelona’s Education Committee has been teaching little rebels about climate change through playful and creative activities at Brunch in the Park. Aimed at ages 3-12, the activities include painting a mural of the earth and completing challenges as part of a “Save the Planet” superhero game. Don’t miss the next activity sessions at Brunch in the Park on September 8th!

###WORKSHOP WEEKEND:September 14-15th

On September 14th and 15th, the Welcome and Training Committee is holding a weekend of workshops for rebels old and new who want to learn more about Extinction Rebellion, the group’s philosophy and its DNA. Workshops will include sessions on Non-violent Direction Action (ADNV), as well as Extinction Rebellion’s demands and core principles. What’s more, you’ll be able to meet and form bonds with other rebels – an essential part of making our grassroots movement work. Stay tuned for more information on the workshops and how to sign up!

We began by saying that now more than ever, we need to spread the word about XR Barcelona and bring as many new rebels as possible on board – and it’s true. The next 18 months will be decisive for the future of the planet, and if we don’t act, no one else will. 

*So stay positive, stay involved, and stay full of love and rage. Together, we’ll be impossible to ignore.*

*XR Barcelona*
