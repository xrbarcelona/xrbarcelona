### TRAINING DAYS IN SEPTEMBER

Dear rebels, 

On Saturday 7th and Sunday 8th of September, were held in the “Espai El Poblet” of Barcelona the first training days designed for people actively involved in Extinction Rebellion Barcelona.  
The program was articulated in a way to offer practical instruments for activism, with particular stress on a regenerative culture perspective.  
On Saturday, more or less 30 people participated to the event: a lot of them were still novice in the group but with great desire to participate and to get more engaged. People from other associations, like Fridays for Future, were present as well. The workshops were offered by two important and experienced collectives: Ecodharma, a community that provides education and retires conceived for activists merging together social implication with Buddhism; and Iridia which, in partnership with Novact, are affiliated to “Defender a quien Defiende” platform.  
Both trainings were of high-quality and extremely interesting.

The first one invited us participants to approach activism taking in account the collective mechanisms that can contribute to a burnout, offering a space for integrating thoughtful practice in our work.  
Second training was highly informative on digital and legal security, with a good balance between a realistic perspective and bravery.  
On Sunday, more or less 12 people participated, even if 30 people were registered for the event. This made us think on the importance to create a culture based on compromise and connection, that will make our efforts effective and sustainable over time

The training in the morning was provided by Laura Yagüe: we were invited to connect with our fellows and ourselves through our bodies and movement.  
Afterward, it was offered by Tatiana Sibilia a training on Non-Violent Communication and Sociocracy: these were presented as fundamental instruments for an effective and sustainable self-governance, that takes care of relationships and processes of our organizations.  
Last training was proposed by Daniel Turon who let us discover the work of Joana Macy through dynamics of listening and shared reflection.

The overall feedback from the training days expressed a general gratification for the generosity of the trainers that shared their knowledge and moreover, it was recognized the necessity to provide these spaces of formation and collective reflection on a regular basis to strengthen and unite the collective.  
A big thank you to all the people that came and committed responsibly to the organizers, it was a pleasure for us to share the weekend with you, seeing that our work beared wonderful fruits.  
We're already organizing next training days, look out!

**See you on the streets.**

*Love and rage (and hope),*
