![Action at the University of Barcelona](/img/blog/2019-09-17-repsol.jpg)

Today, Tuesday 17th of September, Rebel·lió or Extinció Barcelona has made a protest in the building of the Rectorate of the University of Barcelona (UB), in the presentation of the "Repsol Chair of Energy Transition", in the presence of the Rector of the UB, the Councillor for Territory and Sustainability and the President of Repsol.  
We denounce the fact that those who enrich themselves by provoking the climate crisis present themselves socially as bearers of an energy transition that they are obstructing.  
We demand in the public universities that they do not welcome initiatives of washing the image of the big ecocidal corporations.

*Love and Rage*
