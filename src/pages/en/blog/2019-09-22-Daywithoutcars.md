# WORLD DAY WITHOUT CARS

On September 22, coinciding with the world day without cars, we have gathered together with the Fridays for Future Barcelona movement at the entrance of the Barcelona (Meridiana Street)  to demand drastic measures on private mobility in Barcelona.

The air we breathe the inhabitants of the Barcelona area, and other major European cities, not only exceeds the recommended levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas cataloged by the OMS as potentially carcinogenic, but the progress of recent years has been practically inexistend. The modernization of the mobile park, the limitation of parking and speed limits, among other mitigation measures implemented, have not been sufficient, and the benefits derived from the crisis and the reduction of traffic have also been scarce. 
That is why we demand radical measures and at the height that achieve a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other gases dangerous to human health.
