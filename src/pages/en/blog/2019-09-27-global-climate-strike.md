## Thousands of people rebel against the climate emergency in the global climate strike

Rebel·lió o Extinció Barcelona, as part of the platforms that have convened the mobilizations, has been active throughout the week to call for immediate action to stop the climate emergency and expose the crisis to society.

The week of September 20th to 27th has proven the strength of the movement for immediate measures against the climate emergency at an international level. Particularly important in Barcelona is today's climate strike, on the 27th of September, which has managed to bring together more than 300 organisations in the most massive environmental mobilisations that our city has experienced.

In this sense, Rebel·lió o Extinció Barcelona has been a key part of the struggles, as we have already shown with the direct action of last 22nd September, or with the participation in today's climate strike. Together with movements like Fridays For Future, we are succeeding in making more and more visible the need to act immediately to avoid the extinction that the toxic system in which we live is leading us to. The oceans are rising, and so are we.

Among today's actions, we highlight not only civil action and mobilization, but also the fact that we have come to meet with Ada Colau, Mayor of Barcelona, to discuss the implementation of seven concrete actions that she can implement during this mandate, in the next four years. Rebel·lió o Extinció Barcelona, together with the groups Climacció, Families For Future Barcelona, Fridays For Future Barcelona and the Moviment per la Justícia Climàtica, will continue to fight so that the people who govern us immediately implement measures such as those we have presented
to prevent our extinction.

Prior to the October International Rebellion

From Rebel·lió or Extinció Barcelona we consider especially important the capacity of mobilization that we have achieved during this week of struggle. As an international collective, Extinction Rebellion has convened the Second International Rebellion, which will begin on October 7th. All the local nodes of the Extinction Rebellion of the Spanish State will take the fight against extinction in a big mobilization to Madrid to demand immediate actions by the incumbent central
government.

We will continue to rebel with love and rage until our demands are heard and the measures we propose are implemented. As always, we will maintain an unquestionable commitment to non-violence, and make the Rebellion an inclusive, colorful and joyful celebration.

*Love and Rage*
