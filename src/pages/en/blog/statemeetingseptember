![XR Call For Rebels](/img/blog/2019-09-8encuentroestatal.jpg)

This weekend XR Barcelona has participated in the state meeting held in the Garaldea space, just outside the city of Madrid. It has been an opportunity to meet members of other local XR groups in the state, to share ideas and feelings, to continue with the action. 
We have shared the conviction that we want to change the toxic system in which we live, and we have become more convinced than ever that October 7 will be a success, and eager to do so !!!
