    quote: >-
      Una vez que comienza el cambio social, no se puede revertir. No puedes quitar la educación a la persona que ha aprendido a leer. No puedes humillar a la persona que siente orgullo. No puedes oprimir a la gente que ya no tiene miedo. Hemos visto el futuro, y el futuro es nuestro.
      Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. You cannot un-educate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. We have seen the future and the future is ours.s
